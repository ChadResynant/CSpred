# AGENTS.md

## Governance Prerequisite (Non-Negotiable)

**Before any work in this repository, read and comply with:** [`~/repos/governance/INDEX.md`](../governance/INDEX.md)

All cross-repo contracts, policies, and enforcement gates in `~/repos/governance/` are binding. Repo-specific rules below may extend but never override governance contracts.

## Required Reading

This file is intentionally minimal. **You MUST also read `CLAUDE.md` in this repository** — it contains mandatory rules, contracts, and procedures that AGENTS.md does not repeat.

If both files exist, follow both. CLAUDE.md has the detailed guidance; this file ensures Codex agents discover it.

## Agent Rules

- Complete PHASE 0 instruction audit before any code changes
- Read `~/repos/governance/policies/AGENT_INTERACTION_POLICY.md` for full agent protocol
- 3 failed attempts at same fix → STOP and escalate
- 5 failed attempts → FORBIDDEN from further fixes
- Never modify governance documents without Chad's explicit approval
- Always include `Co-Authored-By:` line in commits identifying the agent/model
